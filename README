Wari Rules:

How to move:
1) Select an index on your side of the board (Player 1 is bottom half, Player 2 is top half)
2) The seeds in that index will be distributed counterclockwise one-by-one across the board.

How to score:
Did your seed land in the enemy's row?
  If so:
  Did your final seed land in a hole containing either One or Two seeds, thus causing the hole to contain either Two or Three seeds?
    If so:
    Take all seeds from this hole and add them to your score. Check the previous holes. Do these holes now contain Two or Three seeds?
    Move one-by one back down the line taking points until you come to a hole that has a number of seeds other than Two or Three.
